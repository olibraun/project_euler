#Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
#x^2 - Dy^2 = 1
#For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 - 13*1802 = 1.
#It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.
#By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:
#3^2 - 2*2^2 = 1
#2^2 - 3*1^2 = 1
#9^2 - 5*4^2 = 1
#5^2 - 6*2^2 = 1
#8^2 - 7*3^2 = 1
#Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D <= 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5.
#Find the value of D <= 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.
