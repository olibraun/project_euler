#In England the currency is made up of pound, L, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:
#1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, L1 (100p) and L2 (200p).
#It is possible to make L2 in the following way:
#1*L1 + 1*50p + 2*20p + 1*5p + 1*2p + 3*1p
#How many different ways can L2 be made using any number of coins?
